# CS-300-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

# Summary
Students will develop code as well as use non-coding development methodologies in algorithmic design and problem solving. Students will use advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem solving. 

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the projects for this course, I was given a scenario where acedemic advisors in the computer science department are looking for an application that will load a file into a data structure, print an alphanumeric list of all the courses in the Computer Science department, and print the course title and the prerequisites for any individual course. Project One was to plan and create the Pseudocode for the dessign, where Project Two I wrote the code in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) using C++ and a Binary Search Tree data structure to create the application.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I first analyzed the requirements and identified the best data structures to efficiently store and retrieve course information. Since the application needed to load a file, store courses, sort them alphanumerically, and retrieve specific course details with prerequisites, I used a Binary Search Tree (BST) for quick lookups and a vector for maintaining a sorted order. Understanding data structures is crucial because choosing an incorrect structure could lead to slower lookups or have sorting issues.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame challenges and roadblocks by referring to pseudocode, course materials, and breaking down each parts of the code. By breaking down the code into smaller sections I was able focus on that part making the overall project more managable. When I had a constant error of "could not open the file" I used print statements to see what was going wrong. After writing small parts of the program, I ran tests often to check if the file loaded correctly, the courses were stored properly, and the search function returned the right results. This helped me find and fix problems quickly instead of waiting until the end

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project improved my ability to break down a problem into smaller, manageable steps and choose the best data structures for efficiency. I learned the importance of planning with pseudocode before coding, which made implementation smoother.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project taught me to write cleaner, more organized code with consistent formatting, and using comments to explain key sections. I also learned to break my program into smaller functions and calling those functions in the main function rather than having one main bulky function, making it easier to read and update. By planning ahead writing pseudocode and testing often, I made the code more adaptable, allowing future changes without having to make major adjustments.
